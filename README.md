Spawns are given a 15 minute timer since the timer is assumed to be unknown. (Your maps will likely have a spawnpoint option though)
Command: ```.spawn <pokemon_name> <lat> <lon>```
Example: ```.spawn larvitar 34.101085 -118.287312```

*Raids (currently no eggs):*
Command: ```.raid <gym_name> <pokemon_name> <raid_level> <minutes_remaining>```

Note: Gym names in raids do not have to be completely filled in, just enough so MySQL can find a single gym.
